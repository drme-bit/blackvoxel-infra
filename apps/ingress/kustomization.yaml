# This is a base; do not pin a namespace here.
# Environment overlays (e.g. `envs/staging`, `envs/prod`) should set namespaces
# to avoid accidentally deploying staging/prod into the wrong namespace.
commonLabels:
  app: ingress

# Notes:
# - The file `deployment.yaml` in this directory contains the Ingress resource.
# - If you manage TLS/hosts via cloudflared or cert-manager, consider adding patches or additional
#   resources (Certificates, Issuers) into this kustomization.
